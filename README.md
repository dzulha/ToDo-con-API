# ToDo App

This is a simple **ToDo list application** built with React. It allows users to add and remove tasks, and saves them using `localStorage` so that the data persists between sessions.

## Project Description

The main purpose of this project is to practice **React hooks**, especially `useState` and `useEffect`, and to understand how to work with browser storage. This project is part of my learning journey at the **4Geeks Academy Full Stack Bootcamp**.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Persistent storage with `localStorage`
- Responsive and clean UI with custom CSS

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
