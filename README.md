#  ToDo List with React and Fetch

This project is part of my journey at the **4Geeks Academy Full Stack Bootcamp**. It's the second stage of the ToDo App challenge, where I learned how to **connect a React frontend with a RESTful API** using asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch`).

The app allows users to manage a to-do list that syncs in real time with a remote server.

---

##  Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API
- HTML5 + CSS3
- RESTful API (4Geeks Todo API)
---

##  Features

- Fetch tasks from a remote API on load (`GET`)
- Add new tasks (`PUT`)
- Delete individual tasks (`PUT`)
- Clear all tasks (`DELETE`)
- Sync the task list with a database in real time
- Error handling and status feedback from the API
